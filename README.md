# Bilingual Note Taker
First group project for OSU web development bootcamp

## Description
This is a bilingual note taking application for meetings. 

## Usage
This application can be used for note taking during meetings that require translation. The note-taker is able to begin by giving the meeting a name and choosing their language as well as the language they need to translate to. After clicking the start meeting button, the note-taker is then taken to a page where they can take organized notes and have them automatically translated. When the meeting is over, the meeting title is saved to local storage and can be used to access past meeting notes stored in the Pantry API.
